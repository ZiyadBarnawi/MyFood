# MyFood
 a one page project where I use all the things i learned so far in the HTML CSS course. saldy i started coding before the teatcher tought me about (rem) so I didn't use them because I'm too lazy to change the entire font system and sizing from px to rem so the page is note responsive to all screen sizes but it works just fine on a computer screen
